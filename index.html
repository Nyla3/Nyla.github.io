I would try to write something brilliant and witty in this mundane space contained upon, and in a conceptual world that we immerse ourselves, lose ourselves in, but at the current moment, everything is so ordinary and incredibly dull, the atmosphere I write in is drawing out all the creativity I have to write a impressive introduction that my (nonexistant) audience is supposedly enjoying.

        <p>It's a bright, glorious day outside. The grass is being fried by the lack of water and shade, and the overwhelming amount of sunlight.The people are probably complaining about the heat and the sunburn that they are trying desperately to avoid, then realising they should not be complaining, but enjoying, after which they eventually scumb, letting the sunshine and summer overpower their determination to have a positive attitude, restarting on the infinite loop.
        however, this prison of hot and sunny summer weather is, admitably, is preferable compared to where I am currently, in a classroom, one of hundreds in the laberintine hallways streching under a rather quaint college building, one made of reddish-pink, gritty sandstone, with dark green, shiny-leafed vines crawling up the sides.
        our classroom is, sadly, dismal. The classroom is split in two with a sort of barricade of cabinets made of rough wood, not quite, but almost reaching the celing. The space between the celing and the cabinet is occupied by a dozen or so clear, plastic storage containers, containing paints, vividly colored foam tiles, and other such supplies you would tipically find in a kindergarden classroom. The barridade of cubords is plastered all over with a assortment of science-y posters, laminated and shiny in the flourecent lighting, bearing titles such as "what if we could take an elevator into space?" and "will nanobots take over the workld?" these rather pitiful stabs at brightening up the room do very little. The two walls bordering the cabinets are painted a rather concering color somewhere between peach and cream, too orange to be calmingly cream, and too pale to be upliftingly peachy, </p>
